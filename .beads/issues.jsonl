Begin research using ALL information from parent bead comments\n\n**Research Process:**\nEach sub-bead (infra-8sx, infra-gaf, etc.) is researched in an independent Claude Code session:\n\n1. **Read parent bead:** `bd show infra-3s7` - ALL context is in this bead's comments\n2. **Research the specific sub-bead:** Answer its core questions using codebase exploration\n3. **Document findings:** Add research results as a comment to parent bead (infra-3s7)\n4. **Close sub-bead:** Mark the research task complete\n5. **Next bead:** Next session starts at step 1 with updated context\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- `bd show infra-3s7` provides complete context for each independent session\n- Comments accumulate research findings sequentially\n- No conversation history needed - everything in the parent bead\n- Each session can pick up where the previous one left off\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter all sub-beads researched, synthesize findings into implementation plan.\n\n---\n\n## Network Context\n- /56 delegated from ISP (may change after long power outage)\n- Router assigns /64 per VLAN\n\n## VLAN to IPv6 Prefix Mapping\n| VLAN | IPv4 Subnet | IPv6 Prefix |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| Default | 172.19.74.0/24 | 2600:4040:2ece:7500::/64 |\n| Servers | 172.19.75.0/24 | 2600:4040:2ece:7503::/64 |\n| IOT | 172.20.4.0/22 | 2600:4040:2ece:7501::/64 |\n| Guest | 172.19.77.0/24 | 2600:4040:2ece:7502::/64 |\n\n## IPv6 Address Derivation\nDerive IPv6 from IPv4 to keep addresses human-readable:\n- Use /64 prefix for the VLAN\n- Third IPv4 octet as segment\n- Fourth octet split: hundreds : remainder\n\nExamples:\n- 172.19.74.120 -> 2600:4040:2ece:7500::74:1:20\n- 172.19.74.31 -> 2600:4040:2ece:7500::74:0:31\n- 172.20.4.100 -> 2600:4040:2ece:7501::4:1:0\n\n## Work Required\n- Terraform: subnet-to-prefix mapping, derive IPv6 from IPv4, add AAAA records\n- Ansible: ensure hosts have stable IPv6 (static or disable privacy extensions), sysctl settings","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:30:12.877361-05:00","created_by":"coneill","updated_at":"2026-01-20T14:55:05.929174-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-gaf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.08659-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-8sx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.177447-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-66l","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.269135-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-29t","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.360239-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-4ps","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.472615-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-pof","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.568192-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-tvy","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.652402-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-ao8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.739228-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-gbn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.83129-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"},{"issue_id":"infra-3s7","depends_on_id":"infra-1aa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T14:07:54.926133-05:00","created_by":"Clayton O'Neill"}],"comments":[{"id":3,"issue_id":"infra-3s7","author":"Clayton O'Neill","text":"## infra-8sx: VLAN/Subnet Identification Strategy ✓\n\n**VLAN Distribution:**\n- ALL 15 Ansible inventory servers are on **172.19.74.0/24 (Default VLAN)**\n- Maps to IPv6 prefix: **2600:4040:2ece:7500::/64**\n- Other VLANs (75/Servers, 77/Guest, 20.x/IoT) are **OUT OF SCOPE**\n\n**Server Inventory (Ansible inventory only, 15 total):**\n- 5 Proxmox hosts: p1-p4, p9 (172.19.74.41-44, .155)\n- 4 Kubernetes nodes: k1-k4 (172.19.74.134, .112, .74, .75)\n- 3 VMs: infra1, luser, fs2 (172.19.74.31, .161, .139)\n- 3 Raspberry Pis: garagepi, pantrypi, pantrypi-wifi (172.19.74.216, .120, .118)\n\n**Excluded:**\n- AMT interfaces (p2-amt, p3-amt, p4-amt) -

The provider `CruGlobal/semaphoreui` exists at registry.terraform.io/providers/CruGlobal/semaphoreui with 7,114 downloads and versions up to 1.4.1. CodeRabbit's web search failed to find it.\n\n2. **ID: 2659801315** - \"websocket-client not declared\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Already declared. This project uses Nix for dependency management, not pip. The package is declared in `flake.nix` line 43: `websocket-client`. Per CLAUDE.md, all tools are provided via Nix.\n\n### Copilot False Positives:\n\n3. **ID: 2659796726** - \"Comment wording misleading\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Comment is accurate. Line 8 sets `ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=default` and line 9 sets `ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK_RESULT_FORMAT=yaml`. This IS \"default callback with YAML output format\".\n\n4. **ID: 2659796739** - \"Callback plugins relative path\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Handled correctly. The script explicitly `cd ansible` at lines 56-58 when `ansible/ansible.cfg` exists. The relative path `callback_plugins` resolves correctly.\n\n5. **ID: 2659796749** - \"Checkout SHA outdated\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Factually wrong. SHA `8e8c483db84b4bee98b60c0593521ed34d9990e8` is **v6.0.1** released December 2025 - the LATEST version.\n\n6. **ID: 2659796752** - \"Argument parsing loop\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Wrong. The `*) shift ;;` case handles unknown arguments by shifting past them. The loop terminates when `$#` becomes 0. Standard bash argument parsing.\n\n7. **ID: 2659796754** - \"turnstyle SHA should be tag\"\n   - **Dismissal:** SHA `15f9da4059166900981058ba251e0b652511c68f` is **v3.2.2** released December 2025 - the LATEST version. SHA pinning is intentional security practice.\n\n8. **ID: 2659796756** - \"TAGS_ARG quoting\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Not an issue. Ansible tags are comma-separated identifiers (e.g., `setup,deploy,config`). They don't contain spaces. Unquoted expansion is intentional.\n\n9. **ID: 2659796765** - \"SSH host key checking\"\n   - **Dismissal:** Intentional for homelab. Semaphore pod runs on trusted internal network. All managed hosts are controlled endpoints. SSH host keys change during OS reinstalls.\n\n**Command to resolve comments:**\n```bash\ngh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/1051/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies -X POST -f body=\"Dismissal reason...\"\n```\n\nOr use the pr-triage skill to handle these systematically.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T12:54:45.970631-05:00","created_by":"coneill","updated_at":"2026-01-04T19:25:06.895605-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-04T19:25:06.895623-05:00"}
