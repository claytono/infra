  # Public DNS (IPv4 anycast)

- hosts:
    # Cloudflare Public DNS — global anycast edge, ICMP usually allowed, very low jitter baseline
  - 1.1.1.1
    # Cloudflare secondary — same fabric as 1.1.1.1, watch for occasional route flips between POPs
  - 1.0.0.1
    # Google Public DNS — massive anycast footprint, good long-term latency trendline
  - 8.8.8.8
    # Google secondary — same network as 8.8.8.8, helpful for correlation
  - 8.8.4.4
    # Quad9 filtered — security-focused anycast resolver, sometimes slightly higher RTT than CF/Google
  - 9.9.9.9
    # OpenDNS / Cisco Umbrella — large legacy footprint, stable RTT, some regions rate-limit ICMP bursts
  - 208.67.222.222
    # OpenDNS secondary — pair with 208.67.222.222 for path diversity checks
  - 208.67.220.220
    # Lumen/Level3 legacy resolver — extremely ubiquitous, good “old backbone” reference
  - 4.2.2.2

  # Public DNS (IPv6 anycast)

- hosts:
    # Cloudflare v6 — strong v6 POP coverage, great for IPv6 path health
  - 2606:4700:4700::1111
    # Cloudflare v6 secondary — expect tiny RTT deltas vs ::1111
  - 2606:4700:4700::1001
    # Google v6 — broad peering on v6, very steady latency
  - 2001:4860:4860::8888
    # Google v6 secondary — correlate with ::8888 for route changes
  - 2001:4860:4860::8844
    # Quad9 v6 filtered — good signal for v6 reachability, may be a few ms higher than CF/Google
  - 2620:fe::fe
    # Quad9 v6 secondary — pairs with ::fe for redundancy
  - 2620:fe::9
